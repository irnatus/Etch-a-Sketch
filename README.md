# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch a sketch project from the odin project.

Learned that you can call a function immediately on page load by making an eventhandler on DOMContentloaded event.
Learned how to make a grid using CSS grid. 
Through making the randomizeRGBColor function, tested out a pretty neat trick to changing a css value through a return value from another function.
